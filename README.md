# sentiments
A program that takes a sentiments file, which contains words associated with a score that indicates if the word reflects a negative/positive attitude(refer to sentiments.txt). The program will then allow the user to analyze a single tweet of a string the user may enter, to analyze the negative/positive attitude the string contains depending on the score retrieved using the sentiments.txt file. The program will take into account a multiplier, for which if the user decides to enter a word that multiplies the negative/positive value, such as amplifying the value of a string using "very" before the word "happy." There is a second option for the user to analyze a file, instead of a tweet. Analyzing a file will analyze the text from the file and determine the negative/positive values from the words found in the text file. The word, score, multiplier, and total contribution to the over all score of the file will be printed.
